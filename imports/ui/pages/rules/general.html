			<h1>General Rules</h1>
			<p>Anybody can play! It only takes <strong>$1.00</strong>! The basic premise is that you are predicting what the score of every bowl game will be and whoever has the closest predictions wins! You are able to make/edit <a href="my-picks">your predictions</a> until midnight on December 18th, 2015 which is <strong>{{fromNow}}</strong>.</p>
			<p>The person with the <strong>LOWEST</strong> score will win the whole money pot (minus $1.00) and the person who is in last place at the end of the playoffs will get their $1.00 back!</p>
